Soon:
- One complete test run with all arguments, after that check everything manually for missing or wrong configs
- Checkscript for the most important stuff (especially low latency stuff)
- Transfer Studio-setup knowledge to README
- Add --studio argument for installing Studio software and configs

Long term:
- Search for configurations that can be replaced by DBus Calls (more resiliant as running processes won't overwrite the manual changes in config files from their runtime state in memory)
- Maybe translate this into a more user friendly Python/GUI version if needed
- Or AI could turn this into an Ansible playbook
